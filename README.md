# React + Vite Setup

This template offers a streamlined setup to kickstart a React project with Vite, complete with hot module replacement (HMR) and pre-configured ESLint rules for code quality and consistency.

Currently, two official plugins can be used with this setup:

@vitejs/plugin-react: Utilizes Babel to enable Fast Refresh for efficient HMR during development.
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc: Employs SWC (a fast JavaScript compiler) for Fast Refresh, providing an alternative to Babel with potentially faster build times.
